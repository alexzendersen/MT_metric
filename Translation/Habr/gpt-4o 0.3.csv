HTC HTC Bravo HTC Legend HTC Salsa HTC Tide HTC Buzz HTC Photon HTC Trophy HTC Tera Android Windows Mobile,"Recently, at a presentation organized by HTC for T-Mobile representatives, there was a leak of information about HTC's plans for the next year.

So, the entire HTC product line will be divided into several categories:

Design / Lifestyle — smartphones aimed at the youth market segment: HTC Legend, HTC Salsa.
Social — youth smartphones focused on tight integration with social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Flickr): HTC Tide, HTC Buzz.
Performance — smartphones with thousands of horses under the hood: HTC Bravo.
Productivity — Windows Mobile smartphones designed for the business segment: HTC Photon, HTC Trophy, HTC Tera (remake of Touch Pro2).

According to Eldar Murtazin, this roadmap lacks a couple of key HTC devices, such as the HTC Espresso or the 10-inch HTC Halo Tablet running Android.

Let's move on to the description of the most anticipated smartphone on Habrahabr.

HTC Bravo — the company's first Android smartphone, which is based on the gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon QSD8250 processor, capable of recording HD video in 720p format, has 512 MB ROM, and 256 MB RAM (rumor has it that the RAM size will be increased to 512 MB). It also comes with a 16 GB MicroSD memory card and a 1400 mAh battery. The display is a 3.7"" AMOLED with a capacitive touchscreen. The wait is almost over, the launch date is April 2010! A great competitor for the Xperia X10.

HTC Legend — another Android device that boasts a metal frame and a thickness of only 11.4 mm. Its specifications are more modest than those of the Bravo: 600 MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 as the processor, 3.2"" capacitive display, 512 MB ROM, 256 MB RAM. Judging by the shape, another sibling of the HTC Hero awaits us in March!

HTC Salsa — a gift for fans of Blackberry phones and Android at the same time. Salsa is a curious-looking monoblock with a qwerty keyboard and a very tiny (by modern standards) 2.6"" resistive display. The heart of the smartphone is the Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz. It also has a fairly standard 512 MB RAM and 256 MB ROM. Release date — June 2010.

HTC Tide — not a branded detergent for HTC, but a new Android smartphone designed for social network enthusiasts like Twitter, Facebook, Plurk, Flickr, etc. In terms of specifications, the phone is similar to the HTC Salsa: Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz, 512 MB RAM, and 256 MB ROM. The display is a 2.68"" QVGA with a resistive touchscreen. Release date — April 2010.

HTC Buzz — a new incarnation of the HTC Tattoo, but this time much more attractive, very thin (11 mm), and with a capacitive 3.2"" touchscreen display. Other specifications: Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz, 512 MB RAM, and 256 MB ROM. Fans of expressing their individuality with accessories will get a new toy in May 2010.

HTC Photon — a logical continuation of the HTC Diamond series, HTC Touch Diamond 2, but this time significantly improved, namely: the design, similar to the HTC HD2, catches the eye. The device will also be equipped with a 3.2"" capacitive HVGA display, Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz processor, 512 MB RAM, 256 MB ROM. The thickness of the smartphone is also impressive — only 10.9 mm. The wait is almost over — April 2010!

HTC Trophy — another attempt at the Blackberry market, but this time the smartphone will run on Windows Mobile 6.5. It is also worth noting the pleasant design in the style of the HTC HD2, 3"" capacitive VGA display. The other specifications are standard: Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz, 512 MB RAM, 256 MB ROM. It is worth noting that all HTC phones have significantly slimmed down: the thickness of the HTC Trophy is 11 mm. Premiere — May 2010.

HTC Tera — no more than a remake of the HTC Touch Pro 2, but this time smaller, thinner, and more stylish. Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz, 512 MB RAM, 256 MB ROM, also included is a 3.2"" WQVGA resistive display, a full qwerty keyboard, but most importantly — a thickness of 15 mm! Release date — April 2010.

It is worth adding that the HTC HD2 will be the flagship in the HTC product line throughout 2010, so making a purchase now, you won't have to regret it in 3 months :) HTC is slowly getting rid of Windows Mobile phones, relegating them to the business market segment, while Android occupies all the main niches. Geeks have started saving up for the HTC Bravo, and so have I :)

HTC has done a tremendous job and seems to have tried to outdo everyone: both Samsung with AMOLED displays, and Blackberry with qwerty monoblocks, and Apple with gigahertz processors and support for OpenGL ES 2.0.

HP; HP ProLiant ProLiant G ML DL BL SL HP ProLiant SL hyperscalability high-load systems front-end web server Intel Xeon AMD Opteron Series,"In 1993, HP ProLiant servers, developed based on the x86 architecture, appeared on the market for the first time. The ProLiant family was expanded with new lines as the scope of application for such devices grew. Until recently, you could choose: the ML line – tower servers that you typically buy individually; the DL line – rack-mounted machines for serious tasks, several of which you buy with a significant margin for the future; and the BL line – by filling a rack with a dozen of such blades, you can always add more if demands increase.

But in recent years, BL and their analogs have been used when demands increase tens or hundreds of times – in web search engines, large DBMSs, and scientific supercomputers. Although various technologies are used in the design of these servers to reduce power consumption and compactly place internal components, even a small power saving and size reduction at the level of one server would provide significant economic benefits when operating complexes of several thousand computing nodes.

Therefore, HP specifically developed the HP ProLiant SL6000 line, in which a new form factor is used instead of the standard rack-mounted chassis. Our new system uses a two-unit z6000 chassis, in which several servers share common power supplies and fans. Compared to conventional one-unit servers, power consumption is reduced by 28%, and the overall weight of the server rack is reduced by 31%. A similar solution is used in the BladeSystem chassis for the BL line, but the z6000 does not have a common backplane, which improves air cooling inside the chassis.

As in other HP ProLiant sixth-generation systems, depending on the equipment configuration, the z6000 can use three power supply models: 460, 750, and 1200 watts. To simplify the deployment of large configurations, five SL6000s can be installed in one 10-unit bulk rail kit.

The z6000 houses three types of one-unit dual-processor ProLiant SL server modules based on the Xeon 5500:

HP ProLiant SL170z is designed for applications related to data storage. For example, for search engines and DBMSs. It accommodates 6 full-size SAS/SATA disks and 16 DDR3 SIM memory modules.
HP ProLiant SL2x170z is intended for supercomputing calculations and servicing front-end web applications. It occupies half the width of a 19-inch rack, so four SL2x170z modules can be installed in the two-unit z6000 chassis, doubling the processor power density compared to conventional one-unit servers. This model also supports the installation of 16 DDR3 SIM memory modules but can only accommodate one 3.5-inch hard drive.
HP ProLiant SL160z, designed to work with applications involving intensive use of RAM (e.g., web page caching), is equipped with 18 memory module slots and two PCI slots. It can house two 3.5-inch disks.

Additionally, HP ProLiant SL165z modules based on AMD Opteron 2400 Series will soon be available for sale.

All four models are equipped with a dual-port Gigabit Ethernet adapter and support DCMI and IPMI management with the ability to turn off individual server modules in the chassis.

We can only sincerely wish everyone that your tasks grow to such a scale that expanding your server fleet means purchasing a few more HP ProLiant SL6000 racks! :)"
cyborg Steve Mann glogging glog cyborglogging Big Brother wearable computer eyetap webcam photolog videolog cyborg problems cyberlaw cyberpunk virtual light William Gibson,"It seems that there is a clear interest in Gibson and cyberpunk on Habr: sometimes they write about the adaptation of ""Neuromancer,"" or about a guy from Obscura Digital who waves his hands in the air just like Keanu Reeves in ""Johnny Mnemonic.""

Or suddenly the Habr community will start to worry about why designer Mac Funamizu depicted Gibson's ""Virtual Light"" as a transparent frame and not glasses. And it's completely in vain! Glasses with image processing of the surrounding world have long been realized and are now being perfected by cyborg enthusiast Steve Mann:

Steve has been promoting the ideology of the ""wearable"" computer for several decades, first at MIT and then at his native University of Toronto.

Main areas Steve has worked on:
Development of EyeTap technology. These are the very glasses that intercept the image entering the eye, pass it through a computer, and then transmit it further into the eye. One of the models ready for mass production:

Image processing technologies. For example, Steve holds a patent for the technology of stitching several video frames into a whole picture:

CyborGLOGGING, reverse surveillance. Steve, as a self-respecting cyborg, develops and implements cyborg ideology. Cyborglogging, or simply glogging, is the continuous uploading of videos and photos taken by ""wearable"" cameras. Steve even created a service for gloggers, where he also maintains his own glog. Reverse surveillance is when, instead of the all-seeing eye of Big Brother, the recording is done by a wearable device of an ordinary citizen, usually ""wearable"":

Such surveillance, of course, is initiated not by government agencies for covert control over citizens, but on the contrary, by movement activists for public use in diaries, and all recorded information is as open as possible. This is exactly how Mann sees ideal surveillance: since the information is not secret, there can be no underhanded games and corruption, if someone's rights are violated — everyone will see it. If the recording itself invades someone's private life — no problem, since everything is as open as possible, the information can be immediately deleted.

Cyborg problems
Now the most interesting part: Steve Mann is a staunch ideologist and activist of his inventions and concepts. Therefore, for the last three decades, he has been wearing a pile of iron. This collage has been circulated in almost all online publications, as you can see, until the mid-90s, Steve had a hard time (literally):

Another very interesting fact from Steve's life: on February 18, 2002, Steve was detained by the security service of St. John's Airport, Canada. Until that moment, Steve had been flying around the world without any problems, the security services were satisfied with his package of documents for the equipment (which included a certificate from his personal doctor stating that Steve was conducting an experiment and it was not recommended for him to walk without special equipment). ""The New York Times"" writes: during a personal search, the employees scattered the devices all over the floor (later they forgot to return part of the equipment to the inventor worth almost $57,000), tore off the electrodes from Steve, causing bleeding. After the electronics were disabled, Steve lost his spatial orientation (fell several times, once hit his head on a hanging fire extinguisher), and he was taken to boarding in a wheelchair.

On Slashdot, I found an interesting discussion of the incident. Several of Steve's former and current students commented. They claim that the journalists greatly exaggerated everything, the students personally saw Steve sometimes take off his glasses and move normally, that the inventor's equipment does not contain any biometric sensors, let alone implants. One of Steve's MIT students suggested that if you look at a two-dimensional picture of the world for a long time (through the glasses' screens), disorientation will definitely occur. Someone suggested that Steve was simply very upset by what had happened. In any case, everyone agreed that this is a very indicative case from the series ""what will happen if you deprive a person of gadgets that help him live.""

Several photos
Here are some illustrations that allow you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of what Steve is doing. Here is a group photo of MIT cyborg students participating in Steve's early project to scan the surroundings of the institute:

Concept fantasy ""PleaseWait: I don't talk to strangers."" ""Insert your passport into the reader on my head and only then will I see and hear you. If you want to show me an ad, pay for my attention. Press '3' and insert a credit card"":

Wearable camera in a backpack:

Wearable camera on the chest in a bra:

One of the applications of EyeTap technology, the ""Adissolve"" project (literally ""dissolving ads""), in the illustration, the system recognizes an ad in a magazine and replaces it with a photo uploaded from an art gallery:

The inventor's daughter, Christina Mann, captured using EyeTap glasses a few minutes after birth:

New hobby
Now Steve is fascinated by musical hydro-instruments, but he still does not part with his glasses:

And in this weather, Uncle Sokki got ready and finally carried out his cunning plan. :) Actually, there was no space left on the sheet)) You'll understand which sheet later.

About a month ago, I was looking for some radio station that played only the music that resonates most in my soul and heart. And I stumbled upon the Rock radio, where playing music in high quality costs money (Backstage Pass for only $4.99/month), and in low quality — free, that is, for nothing. Without much thought, I put the audio stream into my favorite Rhythmbox in the radio stations section, and since then I don't remember turning off the speakers and not hearing the sounds of songs by Metallica, AC/DC, ZZ Top, Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper, Queen, Aerosmith, Kiss, and others.

But the article is not about how cool all this is (and it really is cool!), but about my first rock compilation. Hearing a song that pierced me from head to toe, I turned to the sheet and wrote down the band and the song.

Fig.1. The best of the best =))
The next step was to find all this variety. Everything was found, except for the Jingle ""Money"". Then I turned to Twitter users and my friends. Huge thanks to the following people who spent their time helping me in the search:

Vasyok Kuzminov,
Sanyok Timokhin,

Fig.2. Brainstorming
Where our glorious seven didn't search: googling in Yandex =)), on last.fm, in torrents, on free-mp3-sites, on the Rock radio website... I was even ready, and still am, to pay a small fee of $1 (!!!) for this song)) But then we agreed that the band is not popular not only in Russia, not only in Europe, but also in America itself. So it's a dead end.

Well, here's the Rock #1 album:

telephone old hardware cellular communication cellular operators mobile phone analog history nokia nokia russia turbulent nineties post-apocalypse museum museum IT museum of computer history,"Indestructible ""nuclear briefcase.""
A legend of the ""wild nineties.""
Almost the very same ""suitcase with a pipe,"" only more authentic are trunking communication devices and ""RusAltai"" blocks.
Previously, it was in the car of some big shot, and thanks to his careful handling, the device is in very good condition. It's hard to find a better prop for movies about nuclear missiles, spies, and satellite communication with the president.

Under the cut, there are several photos and a story about this phone.

An analog mobile phone, more precisely a ""portable subscriber radio station of the NMT-450 standard."" It was used in the network of the operator MSS (""Moscow Cellular Communication""), which was widely known in the advertisement ""Federal Network SOTEL.""
There are no SIM cards; the number is hard-programmed into the network. SMS is not supported. At all. Voicemail worked ""perfectly"" through the operator's means. The ""phone book"" is a memory for several speed dial numbers without search and familiar navigation.

Excellent reception quality was ensured by a transmitter with a power of 7W (compare with the power of GSM devices, which rarely reach one watt). Reliable operation at the maximum distance from the base station and unparalleled battery life from onboard batteries — a NiMH battery with a capacity of 1700mAh and weighing more than 500 grams squeezed up to 7 days. This device was designed to provide communication in any circumstances, and it always succeeded.

The charger connects directly to the battery, but it can also be connected to the phone — it has an external power input for connection to a car's onboard network or another power source.

A wired telephone line adapter allowed this device to emulate a PBX and make calls through it using a modem, fax, or regular wired phone. A remote wooded area, a stump, with a regular telephone handset on it, the wire from which goes to the line connector on a hidden Nokia 720. Pick up the handset. After a second, the familiar dial tone is heard. You can dial a number.

They say that there are no longer any active networks of this standard — the analog NMT-450 protocol quietly died even in the regions of Russia. There is no longer that range, that autonomy, that power. You can no longer find that mystery, intrigue, and prestige that this device gave its owner. The quality was legendary. Genuine Made In Finland.

The past is irrevocably gone, but this device will live on. It has seen even more. This is one of those devices from which cellular communication as a phenomenon began. One of the best devices. It's not its fault that the standard is no longer supported, and all successors did not inherit its best qualities. They will still remain valuable.

UPD.
Can anyone tell if there are any regions where NMT-450 networks still exist?
This question was asked on netmonitor, it seems like some guys went somewhere supposedly to catch it, but I never saw a report on that trip.

UPD2.
Equipped weight with battery — 1500 grams. The bottom of the device is a ribbed metal radiator.

Year of manufacture — 1996."
ie microsoft browser web development web design firefox internet explorer opera safari javascript java script html layout css css compatibility ajax facebook mobile me apple,"IE6 (Microsoft Internet Explorer 6) was released in 2001. If you look at the date of this post, today is 2008. Various statistics show that about 20% of internet users today continue to use IE6. It is also worth noting that the share of IE6 has been rapidly decreasing since the beginning of 2008.

IE6 does not support standards, does not provide adequate security, and contains a huge number of bugs. To ensure site compatibility with IE6, separate and labor-intensive work is required to track IE6's own errors. Moreover, since 2001, the Internet has not stood still but has rapidly developed towards the so-called Web 2.0, and the use of all the latest technologies is not possible in IE6. For example, the use of complex JavaScript scripts.

Many internet services have officially stopped supporting IE6, including Facebook and Apple's MobileMe.

Thus, today we have a problem: on the one hand, 20% of internet users use IE6, and on the other hand, not all sites can be made compatible with IE6 due to the backwardness of the browser itself.

Why don't users update the long-outdated browser? If you read the forums, you can notice one trend. IE6 is a corporate standard for some companies, and corporate software has been created for it, which is only compatible with it. This is the reason why corporate computers are not updated to the new version of IE, and the installation of third-party browser programs, such as Firefox, Opera, or Safari, is prohibited by security policy.

(If we do not talk only about corporate computers, it is worth noting that Windows Update is enabled by default in Windows XP, and the IE6 browser is automatically updated to IE7 without problems.)

Thus, we have found that IE6 is currently a unique browser that requires special code to be written for the site to be compatible with it.

I believe that for this reason, developing a site compatible with IE6 can be a separate item in the technical specifications for site development. If there is a task to create a modern site compatible with IE6, it is a task to develop two sites. The first is compatible with all the latest browsers, and the second possibly contains somewhat reduced capabilities but is compatible with the outdated IE6.

One of the options to solve the problem of using IE6 could be to determine the browser version and display a warning message that ""the site may not work and look as expected because you are using an outdated browser version,"" and suggest updating the favorite browser to the current version. This is roughly how the internet services mentioned in the article acted.

UPD: Microsoft has created a site with statistics on IE6 usage."
social networks Odnoklassniki ru Odnoklassniki km ru HowGreat ThatWeAllGatheredHereToday ru domain names many letters Guinness Book of Records longest tags on Habr Length of one tag cannot exceed characters,"The social network of the company ""KM Online"" has found its next incarnation. The very network that for a long time felt quite good under the name Classmates.km.ru (copying the name of the progenitor site Classmates.com), and then briefly and ingloriously lived under the nickname Odnoklassniki.km.ru (losing a court dispute over intellectual property to Odnoklassniki.ru), has now received a name that may be recognized as the longest domain name in Runet — KakZdorovoChtoVseMyZdesSegodnyaSobralis.ru. This achievement ""KM Online"" wants to enter into the ""Guinness Book of Records.""

The creativity of the creators of KZCHVMZSS.ru is baffling in its scale and truly makes one think. Just consider these words from the press release: ""The name of the network is a line from a song by Oleg Mityaev. Initially, it was planned to quote the entire verse of the song in the address bar. But, so as not to overly tire the user, the creators of the site settled on the most popular words."" Damn, people with such energy could indeed have bypassed the technical limitation on the domain name length of 63 ASCII characters!

It should be noted that the network already has about 3.2 million users who have survived (or are surviving) the turbulent times of active promotion in Runet. Which is quite a lot, considering that they themselves are unlikely to confidently remember the name of their haven now.

And finally. ""Unlike competitors, the social network KakZdorovoChtoVseMyZdesSegodnyaSobralis.ru will provide only free services. Convenient search for friends by interests, place of study, work, individual informers, convenient blog service, 'invisible' status, and much more. Most of these services are absent in competing social networks."" Competitors in the same text are directly named as ""Vkontakte"" and ""Odnoklassniki.ru"". One can only shrug."

The AppleInsider website publishes another leak from internal Apple sources: the new devices will be equipped with ARM processors designed with Cortex-A9, capable of exceeding the two-gigahertz frequency limit. It is also expected to implement RFID technology, providing contactless authentication.

These news are retold on the Lenta.Ru website. And in the LJ community yota_ru, they are currently discussing whether mobile WiMAX (in particular, Yota) will be among the 4G technologies supported by the new iPhone. There is also a picture that attracts attention:

The most interesting is the list of new features on the right. In particular, the version of the operating system indicated in the illustration raises considerable doubts about the conformity of this concept to objective reality.

Judging by its address, this picture is from the December part of that Brazilian blog, however, not knowing Brazilian, I cannot find the corresponding blog entry there.

The nearest date to check the Korean and Brazilian news is January 27; it is then (if you believe AppleInsider) that Apple plans to present the new iPhone 4.0 SDK to the public. Some developers supposedly received advice from Apple back in December last year to prepare their applications for launch on a screen that will exceed the size of 320×480."
open letter open letter to the President President of Russia Medvedev State Standard Rostekhregulirovanie GOST regulations Civil Code Civil Code of the Russian Federation CC State Duma Council of the State Duma civil society civic consciousness,"There is a blog on LiveJournal called bablaw, whose author also uses the pseudonym Hacker in Law. This is one of the most cited LiveJournal bloggers on Habrahabr; and I myself referred to him just yesterday.

And yesterday this blogger posted an open letter addressed to President Medvedev. I must note that, like any such letter written from a lawyer to a lawyer, it is filled with legal jargon; perhaps for Habrahabr readers, a summary of the matter composed by Nesterovich will be much clearer.

So what do we see in essence? — we are faced with an attempt by Rostekhnadzor (formerly Gosstandart) to transfer state technical regulations from the public domain to the realm of intellectual property of individual organizations (perhaps even foreign ones). Not only are the taxpayers' funds, which supported the creators of GOSTs and for which a significant amount of public property was transferred, being squandered; moreover, now ordinary people are beginning to face a new danger, for example, living in houses and flying in airplanes built according to outdated ""pirated"" copies of standards and regulations, or even with disregard for them.

This attempt is not new; however, the last time (as Nesterovich points out) the state standardizers lost the case when they were sued by representatives of a St. Petersburg non-profit organization (Institute for the Development of Freedom of Information). Nevertheless, the court decision on the free publication of GOSTs on the Internet has not been enforced, and the director of the IRFI was even attacked by unknown persons at his own entrance, resulting in a head injury. Now a new attempt is being made to privatize the standards, carried out under the aegis of President Medvedev personally.

The fourth part of the Civil Code has been much and deservedly criticized, but it still contained Article 1259, according to which official documents of state bodies, official documents of international organizations, as well as their official translations are not objects of copyright (and, therefore, cannot be the subject of licensing agreements with foreign copyright holders, as the new bill makes them). Now, not only will some part of the legislation become accessible to citizens only for money; apparently, the way will be opened for increasing this part. After all, the transfer of the text of laws into the grasping hands of copyright traders (especially international ones) should be as prohibited as the privatization of the Ministry of Finance or the anti-drug service, for example.

Events are unfolding very quickly: the bill on the privatization of GOSTs has already passed the first reading in the State Duma, and yesterday evening (in emergency mode, after the end of the working day) it was recommended by the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy and Entrepreneurship for submission to the State Duma Council. Today the Duma Council will decide to recommend this bill for adoption, and tomorrow (December 23) it will be voted on in the second and third readings immediately by a majority of votes. This once again proves how actively, how obediently, how promptly the Duma serves as a legislative stamp of the President's will.

The open letter, therefore, calls on Medvedev to reconsider his decision and curb the copyright traders. Concerned citizens have already posted a mention of the open letter on Medvedev's blog; I believe it would be interesting to bring this story to the front page of Habrahabr.

Here is the vocal fight for one's rights, here is a truly civil society."

We are excited to inform you that we are now accepting applications to participate in the annual conference for web developers, ""Google Developer Day,"" which will be held on November 10 in Moscow. Last year, more than 400 web developers attended this conference, where they listened to 12 presentations and participated in 6 practical workshops dedicated to various Google products for web developers. This year, we plan to cover Android, App Engine, Google Wave, Chrome, GWT, AJAX API, and much more in detail.

Our engineering teams working on web developer services and APIs will be at the conference, and you will have the opportunity to interact with them directly. We will conduct several in-depth technical sessions aimed at helping developers write good working applications using Google technologies and open technologies. Those working on business applications will also find something useful in the improved and expanded program of our conference. And, of course, developers will have many opportunities to network with each other and discuss the latest mobile and web technologies during ""open hours"" and informal gatherings after the conference.

We are making every effort to ensure that the conference is rich, useful, and interesting! To learn more about the conference and to apply for participation, visit the conference website.

We look forward to seeing you at Google Developer Day!"

I have accumulated several links to such repositories and decided to make this collection, which will surely be useful to someone, and at the same time, someone might share more links, as I only have links to galleries of some, um... IT companies.

The first link I got was for Samsung's photo bank, so I'll start with it. It was sent to me by the company's representatives when I was developing a small booklet for them.

The Samsung photo bank contains a collection of high-quality images of Samsung Electronics products, corporate style elements, as well as photos taken in the Samsung gallery (something like an exhibition center).

The Capture API WC photography video recording audio recording Google Nokia website security privacy external intelligence Facebook Street View StreetView digital crowd surveillance location history facial recognition distributed network vision Maneki-neko,"The W3C website hosts a draft of ""The Capture API"" — it describes a JavaScript interface that allows a website to access the video camera and microphone on a visitor's computer, enabling photography, video recording, and audio recording. This draft consolidates ideas from similar proprietary APIs (from Google and Nokia, in particular).

And it leads me to grim thoughts knowing that the ""Security and Privacy Considerations"" section in this document only states that the website should not be able to conduct photography, video recording, and audio recording without the visitor's consent (i.e., the owner of the client computer or mobile device).

But what about the privacy of other people? Remember the July scandal involving the head of British foreign intelligence, who was exposed on Facebook by his own wife down to his underwear, even though he had never registered on Facebook himself? Now, as websites prepare to see through the eyes of photo-video cameras, the whole world may become open to their view.

Imagine a website that allows a visitor to continuously transmit live video frames from their mobile phone's camera (geotagged by GPS, tilted by accelerometer, rotated by digital compass) and simultaneously observe any point on the globe through the eyes of similar digital observers. Something like Google Street View, but in real-time. Just by turning your mobile phone in different directions while standing at one point on the globe (for example, in Ufa), you could choose to view the panorama of any other point on Earth — such as New York, San Francisco, or Rio de Janeiro — as long as there are enough passersby with similar mobile phones through which the same website looks at the world. Meanwhile, the electronic ""eye"" of your mobile phone similarly surveys and saves the panorama of the point where you are standing on the website.

Exciting, unprecedented experience, isn't it?

Now imagine yourself as an ordinary person in a dense digital crowd.* You are under continuous observation by dozens of electronic eyes provided by anonymous volunteers. Any face and identity recognition system connected to such a website will easily track or reconstruct your entire movement history around the city, just like a sprawling internet banner system tracks your movement across all its sites. Your jealous, crazy admirer will find out what flowers you bought for your wife, and your health insurance company will know how often you coughed while walking in the cold.

But in the real world, there is no Adblock Plus. Blocking a digital crowd is not as easy as blocking banner ads.

Bruce Sterling has a story called ""Maneki-neko""; it's roughly about the same thing. Comments suggest that Vinge also had something similar in his work. But fiction is one thing, and an API draft is another. The API draft is preparing to become a reality.

* This blog post introduces a new Mitsgolisim ""digital crowd"" in the narrow sense of ""a crowd of such people in the real world, whose digital photo-video cameras are used in a distributed network vision system."" It may later generalize to mean ""a crowd of such people in the real world, whose behavior and resources are used for the purposes and needs of a network site."""

social networks erotic photos erotic social networks dating sites social networks for dating paid messages fake profiles paid SMS paid registration free registration phishing naked boobs naked women paid incoming sex dating,"In the second half of 2009, I saw a spreading wave of murky spam in both email and LiveJournal, advertising erotic social networks with the following common despicable features:

1) Their names were pornographic alterations of popular social network names—either ""Odnoklassniki"" (""OdnoLyubovniki,"" ""OdnoNochniki,"" ""OdnoTrakhNiki,"" etc.) or ""Vkontakte"" (""V XXX-kontakte,"" ""V sex-kontakte,"" etc.), mimicking their interface (like phishing) and being hosted on a domain that matched the name.

2) The homepage displayed thumbnail photos of naked women (supposedly users), sometimes with pop-up or captioned elements from profiles (as far as I could tell, names and profiles were pseudo-randomly assigned to the photos, and the city was determined by the visitor's IP). The total number of registered users was exaggerated (if the possibility of search or a separate count of registered users by city was imitated, one could ""find"" many tens of thousands of profiles in a small city, more than the number of internet users).

3) They offered to register for a modest fee by sending a paid SMS. However, in the terms and conditions, in small print (and in a color close to the site's background color), it was explained that the price was per day, and the fee was charged for a month or several months in advance, and they suggested sending several such SMS under some pretext. Thus, the real price turned out to be a hundred times more than the deceptive one.

In general, everything was clear with them.

Now, however, sites are appearing on the horizon with which not everything is clear. They seem not to mimic anyone phishing-wise, and they don't even ask for money for registration, but ask to provide the mobile number to which they will supposedly send an access code to the site. For example, take a look at ""RusssErotika.com"" (note the triple ""s"" in the domain; I won't provide a hyperlink).

What is the new trick then? There must be a trick because it's obvious: sending a registration code to users by email is much cheaper than by SMS.

Are they masking a subscription confirmation for paid incoming SMS under the access code? Or are they collecting mobile numbers for resale to spammers? Or is everything after the free registration incredibly expensive, like in the ""Economic"" hotel from Nosov's immortal satire about Dunno on the Moon?

Who knows?"

A new name. Two versions of the Web IDE have received their official names: JetBrains WebStorm and JetBrains PhpStorm. Branding is not yet complete, so you will see familiar white splashes and WI icons in various places. The development goal remains the same — the perfect tool for PHP/JS developers and web designers.

A fully customizable PHP formatter — this feature received the most votes in the tracker. Our platform supports importing, exporting, and sharing profiles, so it will be convenient for you to switch between projects with different formatting styles. Additionally, you can automatically format code at check-in.

A PHP debugger with optimized memory usage and correct handling of symlinks (which means fewer non-working breakpoints).

A PHP editor with improved type inference for fields, object arrays, and logical expressions, parameter hints, and working HEREDOC editing.

Remote development with automatic file synchronization — just switch to the browser window to see your changes on the server (the ""Save files on frame deactivation"" option must be enabled). Renaming and moving files and folders are fully supported.

Smarty support now covers the entire 2.x branch syntax. Work on full support for the 3.x branch is already underway.

Support for SASS Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets — a wonderful way to create CSS.

Linux users will be pleased with a less aggressive splash screen, the ability to work normally with multiple projects, and support for pasting from the clipboard in all dialogs.

UPD: ZenCoding support is in development. Abbreviations are triggered by pressing Tab in CSS & HTML.

Known issues:

Formatting preview does not work
IntelliLang plugin / Language Injection settings are missing
Smarty compiler plugins (custom tags) are not supported
(S)FTP sync may not work immediately after reopening the project.

Official announcement and download.

I look forward to your feedback and suggestions and — as our slogan says — 
Happy coding!"
php jetbrains IDE web ide web webide editor phpdoc completion debugger xdebug editor development environment development debugging code debugging autocompletion type hinting type inference type inference phpunit unit testing testing FTP remote ZendCon language injection,"And once again, the ""perfect IDE for PHP"" from JetBrains ^) Since the last build, we have managed to get an official website, attend ZendCon'09, and finally start working on the promised performance optimization. We also found time for a few new features. While the build is downloading, take a look under the cut — besides the usual details, there will be a few words about ZendCon and the unique functions of the platform/WI.

ZendCon'09
Before the conference, there were tutorials — for me, the PHP on IBM I5 session was a revelation. IBM has teamed up with Zend to bring PHP to mainframes. Putting aside the i5 ecosystem, this could have significant implications for everyone else, especially if IBM helps develop the core language. Some optimizations have already appeared in 5.3, but judging by other more ""mature"" technologies, the main work is still ahead.

The keynote (and most sessions) were very lively and optimistic — PHP 5.3 was released this year, a new ZendStudio appeared (and 7.1 was released specifically for the conference), the entire Zend stack and toolkit continue to improve, and in general, the language, platform, and community are moving forward :)

During lunches and while most people were in sessions, we talked a lot with Zend employees — and even impressed some ZendStudio developers with our technologies. In turn, we were interested to hear about how they are developing the Eclipse platform and helping coordinate the efforts of the Eclipse Foundation. After all, JetBrains is a fairly small company :) From an engineering perspective, it was interesting to hear about working on the language core and automatic profiling (especially from the point of view of a seasoned java-web-developer).

What's new in this build
Impressed by conversations with users at ZendCon, we focused on optimization. As ""stress tests,"" we used heavyweights like ShugarCRM and Magento (we wanted to try Bitrix but couldn't find a version with open source code). The very first profiling sessions showed that type inference produced too much ""garbage"" in memory and could lead to looping (and freezing) — these problems are now fixed. I want to say right away that this is just the initial optimization, and we plan to seriously work on this further. *We really* want to hear feedback from everyone who upgraded. If you have specific problems, write in any way. I personally process all feedback.

New features:

- Improved PHPDOC generation
- Navigation/search for usages of global variables
- Recognition of class members based on name when type inference is not possible
- SFTP support
- Autocompletion after the keyword new
- Namespaces displayed in the file structure tree
- Quickfix (Alt-Enter) for defining unknown variables using var

Many bug fixes, details in the blog and tracker

Unfortunately, there are also known issues

The most serious — degradation: multiline literals in this build are incorrectly highlighted as containing an error WI-494
Several namespace XXX; declarations (with "";"") in one file will be mistakenly recognized as nested WI-497
Renaming a variable removes the $ sign from the name WI-500

We will try to release an update as soon as possible. Expect bug fixes, optimizations, and of course new features :)

Some non-obvious WI capabilities
The release is approaching, and we have started gathering all information about WebIDE features in one place. Even if you are already familiar with the editor, I recommend at least skimming through the list. Here I will talk about a couple of very useful but not entirely obvious features. So, if PHP is used in your project to generate XML, JS, CSS, SQL, or any other language supported by WebIDE, you can comfortably work with the following functions:

""External"" language for PHP
For each file or folder, you can set an ""external"" language relative to PHP instead of the default HTML through the Settings|Template Data Languages panel. This setting is remembered in the project file.

""Internal"" language for string literals in PHP
Inside the literal, press Alt-Enter and select ""Inject Language,"" then the required language. It is not remembered yet. In the future, you will be able to specify that, for example, the first string parameter of the query() function is SQL (and choose the dialect).

For both cases, full language support will be enabled — including completion and refactoring. Using these features, you can get full support for any combination of languages %)

That's all for now, and I'm looking forward to any questions and suggestions :)"
Prize internet seo web world web awards design copywriting music popularity wwa programming promotion achievements advertising show btl awards develop awards victory Website design Wap PDA sites Flash sites Animation Presentations Interfaces Flash Flex programming PR management,"Since ancient times, people have competed for the title of the best in various fields, and both organizers and participants have always been interested in this. Overall, there are only a few fundamental competitions that set the tone for others, less large-scale, and that follow the principles of the main ones. In every industry, in every type of activity, in every occupation, there is that person or team that does their job better than the rest. Internet awards at this stage are a kind of competition that determines who has best thought out the combination of design and ease of use, informativeness, and, of course, relevance.

The World Web Awards, even at the development stage, have shown that they are unique and large-scale like never before. An award that covers any activity on the Internet, whether it be design, copywriting, SEO promotion, application development, or programming. An award where your name can become so renowned that even people far from the Internet and your field will speak of it as a benchmark of quality in the industry. The uniqueness of the award lies in everything, from the scale and range of people's activities to the presentation, which will be conducted as a show program, with TV broadcasts and radio rotations. Naturally, the winners can expect great fame and success in their field; a recent ordinary person who handled several orders a day, taking on any job, may become popular and in demand after winning, and will be able to refuse inconvenient offers.

The main motivation for participating in the World Web Awards will, of course, be the increase in the popularity of your name, which simultaneously means an increase in your profits. It can be said that popularity is the fundamental factor of successful activity on the Internet. Even if you simply participate in this unique, first Internet award of this kind and scale, you can be sure that the traffic to your project will increase significantly."
