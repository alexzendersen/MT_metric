HTC HTC Bravo HTC Legend HTC Salsa HTC Tide HTC Buzz HTC Photon HTC Trophy HTC Tera Android Windows Mobile,"Just recently, at a presentation organized by HTC for T-Mobile representatives, information about HTC's plans for the next year leaked.

So, the entire product line of HTC will be divided into several categories:

Design / Lifestyle — smartphones aimed at the youth market segment: HTC Legend, HTC Salsa.  
Social — youth smartphones focused on deep integration with social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Flickr): HTC Tide, HTC Buzz.  
Performance — smartphones that have thousands of horsepower under the hood: HTC Bravo.  
Productivity — smartphones running Windows Mobile designed for the business segment: HTC Photon, HTC Trophy, HTC Tera (remake of Touch Pro2).

According to Eldar Murtazin, a couple of key HTC devices are missing from this roadmap, such as HTC Espresso or the 10-inch tablet HTC Halo running Android.

Let’s move on to the description of the most anticipated smartphone on Habrhabr.

HTC Bravo — the first Android smartphone from the company, based on the gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon QSD8250 processor, capable of recording HD video in 720p format, featuring 512 MB of ROM and 256 MB of RAM (rumor has it that the RAM size will be increased to 512 MB). Also included is a 16 GB MicroSD memory card and a battery with a capacity of 1400 mAh. The display is a 3.7"" AMOLED with a capacitive touchscreen. The wait is almost over, the launch date is April 2010! A great competitor for the XPeria X10.

HTC Legend — another Android device that boasts a metal frame and a thickness of only 11.4 mm. Its specifications are more modest than those of the Bravo: 600 MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 as the processor, a 3.2"" capacitive display, 512 MB of ROM, and 256 MB of RAM. Judging by the shape, in March we’ll see another sibling of the HTC Hero!

HTC Salsa — a gift for fans of both Blackberry-style phones and Android at the same time. Salsa is a wonderfully designed monoblock with a QWERTY keyboard and a very tiny (by modern standards) 2.6"" resistive display. The heart of the smartphone is a Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz. It also has the standard 512 MB of RAM and 256 MB of ROM. The release date is June 2010.

HTC Tide — this is not a branded washing powder for HTC but a new Android smartphone designed for social network enthusiasts like Twitter, Facebook, Plurk, Flickr, etc. In terms of specifications, the phone is similar to the HTC Salsa: Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, and 256 MB of ROM. The display is a 2.68"" QVGA with a resistive touchscreen. The release date is April 2010.

HTC Buzz — a new incarnation of HTC Tattoo, but this time much prettier, very thin (11 mm), and also featuring a 3.2"" capacitive touchscreen display. Other specifications include Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, and 256 MB of ROM. Fans of highlighting their individuality with accessories will receive a new toy in May 2010.

HTC Photon — a logical continuation of the HTC Diamond series, HTC Touch Diamond 2, but this time significantly more advanced, particularly: the design is reminiscent of the HTC HD2. The device will also be equipped with a 3.2"" capacitive HVGA display, a Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 256 MB of ROM. The thickness of the smartphone is also impressive — only 10.9 mm. The wait is almost over — April 2010!

HTC Trophy — another attempt to penetrate the Blackberry market, but this time the smartphone will run Windows Mobile 6.5. A pleasant design in the style of the HTC HD2 and a 3"" capacitive VGA display should also be noted. Other specifications are standard: Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, and 256 MB of ROM. It’s worth mentioning that all HTC phones have significantly slimmed down: the thickness of the HTC Trophy is 11 mm. Premiere — May 2010.

HTC Tera — no more than a remake of the HTC Touch Pro 2, only this time smaller, thinner, and sleeker. Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz, 512 MB of RAM, 256 MB of ROM, also included is a resistive 3.2 WQVGA display, a full QWERTY keyboard, but most importantly — a thickness of 15 mm! Release date — April 2010.

It should be added that the HTC HD2 will be the flagship in the HTC product line throughout 2010, meaning that buying now will not lead to regrets in three months :) HTC is slowly getting rid of Windows Mobile phones, relegating them to the business market segment, while all main niches are occupied by Android. Tech enthusiasts have started saving up for the HTC Bravo, and I am too :)

HTC has done an enormous job and seems to have made an effort to outclass everyone: Samsung with AMOLED displays, Blackberry with QWERTY monoblocks, and Apple with gigahertz processors and support for OpenGL ES 2.0.

HP; HP ProLiant ProLiant G ML DL BL SL HP ProLiant SL hyperscale high-load systems front-end web server Intel Xeon AMD Opteron Series,"In 1993, HP ProLiant servers, developed based on x86 architecture, first appeared on the market. The ProLiant family expanded with new series as the application areas for such devices grew. Until recently, one could choose from the ML line – tower servers, which you usually buy individually; DL – rack servers for serious tasks, several of which you purchase with significant future capacity in mind; and BL – by filling a rack with a dozen of such blades, you can always add more if demand increases.

However, in recent years, BL and their analogs have been used when demands increase by tens and hundreds of times – in web search engines, large databases, and scientific supercomputers. Although various technologies are applied in the design of these servers to ensure reduced power consumption and compact placement of internal components, even a small power saving and reduction in dimensions at the level of a single server would have a significant economic effect when operating systems with several thousand computing nodes.

Therefore, HP specifically developed the HP ProLiant SL6000 series, which uses a new form factor instead of a standard rack mount case. Our new system utilizes a two-unit chassis z6000, where multiple servers share common power supplies and fans. Compared to regular one-unit servers, power consumption is reduced by 28%, and the overall weight of the server rack is reduced by 31%. This solution is also used in the BladeSystem chassis for the BL series, but the z6000 does not have a common unifying panel, improving airflow cooling within the chassis.

As with other HP ProLiant sixth-generation systems, depending on the equipment configuration in the z6000, three models of power supplies can be used: 460, 750, and 1200 watts. To simplify the deployment of large configurations, five SL6000 can be installed in one 10-unit bulk rail kit.

Three types of one-unit dual-processor ProLiant SL server modules based on Xeon 5500 are installed in the z6000:

The HP ProLiant SL170z is designed for data storage applications, such as search engines and databases. It accommodates 6 full-size SAS/SATA disks and 16 DDR3 SIM memory modules.
The HP ProLiant SL2x170z is intended for supercomputing calculations and servicing front-end web applications. It takes up half of a 19-inch rack width, allowing four SL2x170z modules to be installed in the two-unit z6000 chassis, effectively doubling the density of processing power compared to regular one-unit servers. This model also supports the installation of 16 DDR3 SIM memory modules but can only accommodate one 3.5-inch hard drive.
The HP ProLiant SL160z, designed for working with memory-intensive applications (such as web page caching), is equipped with 18 memory module slots and two PCI slots. It can host two 3.5-inch drives.

Additionally, HP ProLiant SL165z modules based on AMD Opteron 2400 Series will soon be available for sale.

All four models are equipped with a dual-port Gigabit Ethernet adapter and support DCMI and IPMI management with the ability to turn off individual server modules in the chassis.

All that remains is to sincerely wish everyone that your tasks grow to such scales that expanding the server fleet will mean purchasing a few more HP ProLiant SL6000 racks! :)"
cyborg Steve Mann glogging glog cyborglogging big brother wearable computer eyetap webcam photolog videolog problems of cyborgs cyber law cyberpunk virtual light William Gibson,"It seems that there has been a noticeable interest in Gibson and cyberpunk on Habr: sometimes they write about the adaptation of ""Neuromancer,"" sometimes about a colleague from Obscura Digital who moves his hands in the air just like Keanu Reeves in ""Johnny Mnemonic."" 

And suddenly, the Habr community starts to worry why designer Mak Funamizu depicted Gibson's ""virtual light"" as a transparent frame instead of glasses. And it's completely pointless! Glasses that process images of the surrounding world have long been realized, and are currently being perfected by cyborg enthusiast Steve Mann:

For several decades, Steve has been promoting the ideology of the ""wearable"" computer, first at MIT, then at his alma mater, the University of Toronto.

The main areas Steve has worked on:
Development of EyeTap technology. These are the very glasses that intercept the incoming image into the eye, and, after processing it through a computer, pass it on to the eye. One of the models ready for mass production:

Image processing technologies. For example, Steve has a patent for the technology of stitching multiple video frames into a single picture:

CyborGLOGGING, reverse surveillance. As a self-respecting cyborg, Steve develops and implements cyborg ideology. Cyborglogging, or simply glogging, is the continuous posting of videos and photographs taken with ""wearable"" cameras. Steve even created a service for gloggers, where he also maintains his own glog. Reverse surveillance is when, instead of the all-seeing eye of Big Brother, the recording is done by a wearable device of an ordinary citizen, usually ""wearable"":
 
Such surveillance is, of course, not initiated by state services for covert control over citizens, but rather by activists of the movement for public use in diaries, where all recorded information is as open as possible. This is how Mann envisions ideal surveillance: since the information is not secret, there can be no underhanded games or corruption—if someone's rights are violated, everyone will see it. If the recording intrudes into someone's private life—it’s not a problem, since everything is as open as possible, the information can be deleted immediately.

Problems of the cyborg. Now for the most interesting part: Steve Mann is an ardent ideologist and activist of his inventions and concepts. That’s why for the last three decades he has carried a heap of hardware. This collage has circulated in nearly all Internet publications, as you can see, through the mid-90s Steve had a hard time (in the literal sense):

Another very interesting fact from Steve's life: on February 18, 2002, Steve was detained by security at St. John's airport in Canada. Until that moment, Steve had flown around the world without hindrance, security services were satisfied with his documentation for the equipment (which included a note from his personal doctor stating that Steve was conducting an experiment and it was not recommended for him to go without special equipment). ""The New York Times"" reports: during a personal search, the staff scattered the devices all over the floor (later, they forgot to return part of the equipment worth nearly $57,000), and electrodes were torn from Steve, causing bleeding. After the electronics were disabled, Steve lost spatial orientation (he fell several times, once hitting his head on a hanging fire extinguisher), and was wheeled to his boarding in a stretcher.

On Slashdot, I found an interesting discussion of the incident. Several former and current students of Steve wrote in. They claim that journalists exaggerated everything significantly; students personally saw that Steve sometimes takes off his glasses and walks normally, and that the inventor's equipment does not contain any biometric sensors, let alone implants. One of Steve's MIT students suggested that if you look at a two-dimensional picture of the world for a long time (through the glasses' screens), disorientation will inevitably occur. Someone suggested that Steve was simply very upset by what happened. In any case, everyone agreed that this is a telling case in the series ""what happens when a person is deprived of the gadgets that help him live.""

A few photos. I will provide several illustrations that help to immerse oneself in the atmosphere of what Steve does. Here’s a group photo of cyborg students from MIT participating in an early project of Steve’s on scanning the surroundings of the institute:

Concept fantasy ""PleaseWait: I do not talk to strangers."" ""Insert your passport into the reader on my head and only then will I see and hear you. If you want to show me an advertisement, pay for my attention. Press '3' and insert your credit card"":

A wearable camera in a backpack:

A wearable camera in a bra:

One of the applications of EyeTap technology, the ""Adissolve"" project (literally ""dissolving advertisement""), in the illustration the system recognizes an ad in a magazine and replaces it with a photo uploaded from an art gallery:

The inventor's daughter, Christina Mann, captured through EyeTap glasses just a few minutes after birth:

New hobby. Now Steve is interested in musical hydro-instruments, however, he still does not part with his glasses:

ACDC Alice Cooper Def Leppard Elvis Presley Iron Maiden Queen Scorpions Survivor The Offspring Velvet Revolver ZZ Top rock lastfm google friends,"Hello and stay healthy, dear Habravchans! =)) The weather in Moscow is terrible right now: it's cold, the thermometer shows 13 degrees Celsius, but it feels like around 7-8, there's no sun, the wind is from the north, at least there's no rain. And in this weather, Uncle Sokki gathered himself and finally carried out his cunning plan. :) In fact, there was no room left on the sheet of paper)) You will understand what sheet I mean later.

About a month ago, I was searching for a radio station that played only the music that resonates the most in my soul and heart. I stumbled upon the Rock radio, where streaming music in high quality costs money (Backstage Pass for only $4.99/month), while low quality is free, meaning it’s on the house. Without thinking much, I put the audio stream into my favorite Rhythmbox in the radio station section, and since then I can't remember turning off the speakers and not hearing the sounds of Metallica, AC/DC, ZZ Top, Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper, Queen, Aerosmith, Kiss, and others.

But this article isn't about how cool all this is (and it really is cool!), but about my first rock compilation. Hearing a composition that pierced me from head to toe, I turned to my sheet of paper and wrote down the band and the song.

Fig.1. The best of the best =))

Next, it was just a matter of finding this variety. Everything was found, except for Jingle ""Money."" Then I turned to the Twitter community and my friends. I express my huge thanks to the following people who spent their time helping me in the search:

vfaronov,  
Vasyok Kuzminov,  
Sanyok Timokhin,  
Damirock,

Where our glorious seven didn’t search: we googled on Yandex =)), on last.fm, on torrents, on free mp3 giveaway sites, on the Rock radio website… I was even willing, and I’m still willing, to pay a small fee of $1 (!!!) for that song)) But then we came to the conclusion that the band is not very popular not only with us in Russia, not only in Europe, but also in America itself. So it’s tough going. 

And here is, in fact, the Rock #1 album:

telephone old hardware mobile communication mobile operators mobile phone analog history Nokia Nokia Russia wild nineties post-apocalypse museum IT museum computer history,"Indestructible ""nuclear briefcase.""  
The legend of the ""wild nineties.""  
Practically the same as the ""briefcase with a tube,"" only more authentic than the trunking communication devices and ""RusAltai"" blocks.  
Previously used in the car of some cool guy; thanks to his careful handling, the device is in very good condition. It’s hard to find better props for movies about nuclear missiles, spies, and satellite communication with the president.  

Below are several photos and a story about this phone.

Analog mobile phone, more precisely, a ""portable subscriber radio station standard NMT-450."" Used in the network of the operator MSC (""Moscow Cellular Communication""), which was widely known in the advertisement ""Federal Network SOTEL.""  
No SIM cards; the number is hard-coded in the network. SMS is not supported. At all. Voice mail via the operator worked ""like a charm."" The ""phone book"" is just a memory for several speed-dial numbers without search or familiar navigation.

Excellent reception quality was ensured by a 7W transmitter (compared to GSM devices rarely reaching one watt). Reliable operation at maximum distance from the base station and unmatched battery life from onboard batteries—a 1700mAh NiMH battery weighing over 500 grams could last up to 7 days. This device was designed to provide communication under any circumstances, and it always succeeded.

Charging connects directly to the battery, but it can also connect to the phone—there's an external power input for connecting to the vehicle's onboard network or another source.

A wired telephone line adapter allowed this device to emulate a PBX and make calls through it with a modem, fax, or regular wired phone. In a distant wooded area, a stump with a regular telephone device and a cord leading to a line connector on a hidden Nokia 720. We pick up the receiver. After a second, the familiar dial tone is heard. You can dial the number.

They say there are no longer any active networks of this standard—analog protocol NMT-450 has quietly died even in the regions of Russia. Neither that range, nor that independence, nor that power can be found anymore. The mystery, enigma, and prestige that this device gave its owner are gone. The quality was legendary. Truly Made in Finland.

The past is irrevocably lost, but this device will live on. It has seen much. This is one of those devices that marked the beginning of cellular communication as a phenomenon. One of the best devices. It’s not its fault that this standard is no longer supported, and all successors did not inherit its best qualities. They will still retain their value.

UPD.  
Who can tell me if there are any regions where NMT-450 networks still exist?  
I asked this question on netmonitor; it seems that the guys went somewhere supposedly to catch signal, but I never saw a report on that trip.

UPD2.  
The equipped mass with the battery is 1500 grams. The bottom of the device features a ribbed metal radiator.

ie microsoft browser web development web design firefox internet explorer opera safari javascript java script html layout css css compatibility ajax facebook mobile me apple,"IE6 (Microsoft Internet Explorer 6) was released in 2001. Looking at the date of this post, it is now 2008. Various statistics show that about 20% of internet users continue to use IE6 today. It is also worth noting that the share of IE6 has been rapidly decreasing since the beginning of 2008.

IE6 does not support standards, does not provide adequate security, and contains a huge number of bugs. To ensure compatibility of websites with IE6, separate and labor-intensive work is required to track the bugs of IE6 itself. Moreover, since 2001, the Internet has not stood still but has rapidly evolved towards what is known as Web 2.0, and the use of all the latest technologies is not possible in IE6. For example, the use of complex JavaScript scripts.

Many internet services have officially discontinued support for IE6, including Facebook and Apple’s MobileMe.

Thus, today we have a problem: on one hand, 20% of internet users use IE6, and on the other, not all websites can be made compatible with IE6 due to the browser’s outdatedness.

Why do users not upgrade their long-outdated browser? If you read the forums, you can note one trend. IE6 is a corporate standard for some companies, and corporate software has been created for it which is only compatible with that browser. This is the reason that updates to a new version of IE are not made on corporate computers, and the installation of third-party browsers, such as Firefox, Opera, or Safari, is prohibited by security policy.

(If we don't only talk about corporate computers, it is worth noting that Windows Update is enabled by default in Windows XP, and the IE6 browser automatically updates to IE 7 without any problems.)

Thus, we have determined that IE6 is currently a unique browser that requires special code to ensure website compatibility.

I believe that for this reason, the development of a website compatible with IE6 can be a separate item in the technical specifications for website development. If there is a task to create a modern website compatible with IE6—this is a task for developing two websites. The first is compatible with all the latest browsers, and the second may have slightly reduced capabilities but is compatible with the outdated IE6.

One way to resolve the problem of using IE6 may be to detect the browser version and display a warning message stating that “the website may not function and look as expected because you are using an outdated version of the browser,” and suggest updating to the latest version of the preferred browser. This is approximately how the aforementioned internet services have acted.

UPD: Microsoft has created a website with statistics on the use of IE6."
social networks Odnoklassnikiru Odnoklassnikskmru HowGreat ThatWeAreAllGatheredHereTodayru domain names many letters Guinness World Records the longest tags on Habr The length of one tag cannot exceed characters,"The social network of the company ""KM Online"" has found its latest incarnation. This is the same network that felt quite well under the name Classmates.km.ru for a long time (copying the name of the parent site Classmates.com) and then briefly and ignobly lived under the nickname Odnoklassniki.km.ru (losing a legal dispute over intellectual property to Odnoklassniki.ru), which has now received a name that could be recognized as the longest domain name in the Russian internet — KakZdorovoChtoVseMyZdesSegodnyaSobralis.ru. This achievement is something that ""KM Online"" wants to submit to the ""Guinness World Records.""

The creativity of the creators of KZCHVMS.ru is baffling in its scale and truly makes one think. Just consider these words from the press release: ""The name of the network is a line from Oleg Mityaev's song. Initially, it was planned to quote the entire verse of the song in the address bar. However, to avoid tiring the user too much, the creators of the site settled on the most popular words."" Damn, with such energy, people could really get around the technical limitation of a 63-character ASCII domain name!

It is worth noting that there are already about 3.2 million users in the network, who have experienced (or are experiencing) the turmoil of active promotion in the Russian internet. This is quite a lot, considering that they are unlikely to confidently recall what their haven is called now.

And lastly, ""Unlike competitors, the social network KakZdorovoChtoVseMyZdesSegodnyaSobralis.ru will provide only free services. Convenient friend search by interests, place of study, work, individual informers, convenient blog services, 'invisible' status, and much more. Most of these services are absent in competitive social networks."" The competitors mentioned in the same text are explicitly referred to as ""VKontakte"" and ""Odnoklassniki.ru."" It remains only to throw up one’s hands."

These news items are summarized on the Lenta.Ru website. Meanwhile, in the LJ community yota_ru, they are currently discussing whether mobile WiMAX (specifically, Yota) will be among the 4G technologies supported by the new iPhone. There, a picture is provided that draws attention:

Most of all, the list of new features on the right side draws interest. In particular, the version of the operating system indicated in the illustration raises significant doubts about the correspondence of this concept to objective reality.

Judging by its address, this picture is from the December part of that Brazilian blog; however, lacking knowledge of Brazilian, I cannot find the corresponding blog post there.

The nearest date for checking Korean and Brazilian news is January 27; it is then (if we are to believe ""AppleInsider"") that Apple intends to present the new iPhone 4.0 SDK to the public. Some developers reportedly received advice from Apple in December of last year to prepare their applications for a screen that will exceed the dimensions of 320×480."
open letter open letter to the President President of Russia Medvedev State Standards State Regulation GOST regulations Civil Code Civil Code of the Russian Federation State Duma Council of the State Duma civil society civic consciousness,"On LiveJournal, there is a blog called bablaw, whose author also goes by the pseudonym Hacker in Law. He is one of the most cited bloggers on Habrhabr; I referred to him just yesterday.

And yesterday, this blogger published an open letter addressed to President Medvedev. I must point out that, like any such letter written from one lawyer to another, it abounds in legal terminology; perhaps a summary of the matter compiled by Nesterovich will be much clearer for Habrhabr readers.

So, what do we see in essence? — we are presented with an attempt by Rostekhnadzor (formerly Gosstandart) to transfer state technical regulations from the realm of public domain into the realm of intellectual property belonging to individual organizations (possibly even foreign ones). Not only is that taxpayer money wasted on which the creators of GOSTs existed, resulting in a fat nothing being transferred to public ownership; moreover, a new danger now begins to threaten ordinary people, such as living in houses and flying in planes built according to outdated “pirate” copies of standards and regulations, or neglecting them altogether.

Such an attempt is not new; however, last time (as Nesterovich points out), government standardizers lost the case when representatives of a St. Petersburg non-profit organization (Institute for the Development of Freedom of Information) sued them. Nevertheless, the court ruling on the free publication of GOSTs on the Internet has not been implemented, and the director of IRSI was even attacked by unknown individuals at his own entrance, resulting in a head injury. Now a new attempt at the privatization of standards is being made under the personal auspices of President Medvedev.

The fourth part of the Civil Code has been much and rightly criticized, but still, it contained Article 1259, according to which official documents of government bodies, official documents of international organizations, as well as their official translations are not objects of copyright (and therefore cannot be subjects of licensing agreements with foreign rights holders as they are made by the new draft law). Now, not only will some part of the legislation become accessible to citizens only for money as a result of all this; apparently, the way will be opened for increasing this portion. After all, the transfer of the text of laws into the greedy hands of legal traders (especially international ones) should be just as forbidden as the privatization of the Ministry of Finance or anti-drug services, for example.

Events are unfolding very quickly: the draft law on the privatization of GOSTs has already passed its first reading in the State Duma, and yesterday evening (in a rush, after the end of the workday) it was recommended by the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy and Entrepreneurship to be presented to the Council of the State Duma. Today, the Duma Council will decide to recommend this draft law for adoption, and tomorrow (December 23) it will vote on it in the second and third readings, with a majority of votes at once. This proves once again how diligently, how obediently, and how promptly the Duma serves as a legislative stamp of the President's will.

Thus, the open letter calls on Medvedev specifically to reconsider his decision and rein in the legal traders. Concerned citizens have already posted a mention of the open letter on Medvedev's blog; I believe it would be interesting to bring this story to the front page of Habrhabr.

This is a public struggle for rights; this is truly a civil society."

I have accumulated several links to such repositories, and I decided to make this compilation; surely it will be useful to someone, and at the same time, someone might share more links, as I only have links to galleries from some, uh... IT companies.

The link to Samsung's photo bank was the first one I got, so I'll start with it. It was once shared with me by company representatives when I was developing a small brochure for them.

Samsung's photo bank contains a collection of high-quality images of Samsung Electronics products, corporate identity elements, as well as photographs taken in the Samsung gallery (something like an exhibition center).

Photos and press releases for Apple products. Before downloading an image, you will be asked to read the Image Use Agreement: According to the terms of the Agreement, you may use the Image only for editorial purposes by analysts in journalism and/or the relevant industry. This usage right belongs to you personally and cannot be transferred to another party. The image may not be used for advertising or selling any products or technologies (including promotional images, brochures, book covers, product photographs, t-shirts, and other promotional materials). You are not allowed to alter or modify the image, in whole or in part, for any purposes.

Photo bank and advertising materials from BBK.

Everything you need from Sony, including Sony Ericsson.

Photo bank, advertising, news, and press releases from Panasonic. It doesn't always work; sometimes it works but doesn't return images, and the content often changes. There used to be a large photo bank on a Ukrainian site, but now it shows ""404,"" and the domain redirects to panasonic.ru. There’s also http://panasonic.multiad.com/, but you need to register there.

Photo materials from Siemens's Gigaset division and press materials from Siemens. Siemens has many divisions and various corporate websites for these divisions, and there is something on each (well, or almost every) of them. So if anyone needs it, there’s a starting point for searches :)

Large JPEGs from Toshiba.

Image bank of DELL products.

Fujitsu.

Lenovo computers. There’s also a Russian site with photos of Lenovo products, but at the time of writing this article, it was unavailable.

That's all for now. If anyone has something else to share in this spirit, please post the link in the comments, and I will update the post as they come in. The theme, I think, does not necessarily have to be in the IT field; the main thing is that it should be an official photo bank of the company.

The Capture API WC photography video recording audio recording Google Nokia website security privacy external intelligence Facebook Street View StreetView digital crowds observation movement history facial recognition distributed network vision Maneki-neko,"On the W3C website, there is a draft of ""The Capture API"" — it describes a JavaScript interface through which a website can access the camera and microphone on a visitor's computer, can take photos, record videos, and audio. This draft summarizes ideas from similar proprietary APIs (specifically from Google and Nokia).

And I am led to dark thoughts by the knowledge that the section ""Security and Privacy Considerations"" in this document only states that a website should not be able to take photos, record videos, and audio without the visitor's consent (that is, the consent of the owner of the client computer or mobile device).

What about the privacy of other people? Remember the July scandal involving the head of British intelligence who was exposed on Facebook by his own wife down to his underwear, although he had never registered on Facebook himself? Now, as websites prepare to see through the eyes of cameras, the whole world may be opened up to their view.

Imagine a website that allows a visitor to continuously stream live video footage from their mobile device's camera (geotagged by GPS, tilted by an accelerometer, rotated by a digital compass's azimuth) while simultaneously observing any point on the Earth through the eyes of other digital observers. Something like Google Street View, but in real-time. Just by turning your mobile device in different directions while standing at a single point on the globe (for example, in Ufa), you could choose to gaze ""through"" its screen (like a window) at the panorama of any other location on Earth — some New York, San Francisco, or Rio de Janeiro — as long as there are enough passersby with similar mobile devices looking out at the world through the same website. Meanwhile, the electronic ""eye"" of your mobile device similarly surveys and saves the panorama of the spot where you are standing.

Exciting, unprecedented experience, isn’t it?

Now imagine yourself as an ordinary person in a dense digital crowd.* You are under the constant watch of dozens of electronic eyes provided by anonymous volunteers. Any facial and identity recognition system connected to such a website will easily track or reconstruct your entire movement history through the city, just as an elaborate internet banner ad system tracks your movement across all its sites. Your jealous, psychotic admirer finds out what flowers you bought for your wife, and your health insurance company learns how often you coughed while walking in the cold.

But in the real world, there’s no Adblock Plus. A digital crowd is not so easy to block as banner ads.

Bruce Sterling has a story called ""Maneki-neko""; it’s about the same thing. Commenters suggest that Vinge had something similar in his work. But one thing is fiction, while another is a draft of an API. The API draft is preparing to become a reality.

___________

* This blog post introduces a new term ""digital crowd"" in the narrow sense of ""a crowd of such people in the real world, whose digital cameras are used in a system of distributed network vision."" It may further generalize to mean ""a crowd of such people in the real world, whose behavior and resources are used for the purposes and needs of a network site."""

social networks erotic photos erotic social networks dating sites social networks for dating paid messages fake profiles paid SMS paid registration free registration phishing nude boobs naked women paid incoming sex dating,"In the second half of 2009, I saw a spreading wave of murky spam in both email and LiveJournal, advertising erotic social networks that had the following common, disgusting features:

1) Their names were pornographic parodies of popular social networks — either ""Odnoklassniki"" (""Odnolyubovniki,"" ""Odnonochki,"" ""Odnotrakhinki,"" etc.), or ""VKontakte"" (""V XXX-kontakte,"" ""V sex-kontakte,"" etc.), imitating their interface (similar to phishing) and located on a domain that matched the name.

2) The homepage displayed thumbnail photos of naked women (supposedly users), sometimes with pop-ups or inscribed elements from profiles (as far as I could notice, names and profiles for the photos were substituted pseudo-randomly, and the city by the visitor's IP). The total number of registered users was exaggerated (if the possibility of searching or a separate count of registered users by cities was imitated, then one could ""find"" many tens of thousands of profiles in a small city, which is more than the actual number of internet users available).

3) They offered registration for a modest fee by sending a paid SMS. However, in the rules, fine print (and color close to the background color of the site) explained that the price was indicated per day, while the charge was taken for a month or several months in advance, and such SMS were suggested to be sent multiple times under some pretext. Thus, the actual price ended up being several hundred times higher than the deceptive one.

Overall, everything was clear with them.

Now, however, there are websites on the horizon which are not so clear. They do not seem to mimic anyone phishily, and they do not even ask for money for registration; instead, they request the mobile number to which they will supposedly send the access code to the site. For example, take a look at ""RusssErotika.com"" (note the triple ""s"" in the domain; I won't provide hyperlinks).

What then is the new trick? There must be a trick because it’s obvious: it is much cheaper to send a registration code to users via email than via SMS.

Are they disguising confirmation of subscription to paid incoming SMS under the access code? Or are they collecting mobile numbers for resale to spammers? Or does an incredibly expensive everything else follow after free registration, like in the ""Economic"" hotel from the immortal fairy tale-satire by Nosov about Neznaika on the Moon?

Who knows?"
php jetbrains IDE web ide web webide editor phpdoc completion debugger xdebug editor development environment debugging code debugging autocompletion type hinting type inference type deduction phpunit unit testing testing FTP remote SASS Smarty,"In this build, you can expect:

A new name. Two versions of the Web IDE have received their official names: JetBrains WebStorm and JetBrains PhpStorm. The branding is not finished yet, so you will see the familiar white splashes and WI icons in various places. The goal of development remains the same — an ideal tool for PHP/JS developers and web designers.

Fully customizable PHP formatter – this feature received the most votes in the tracker. Our platform supports importing, exporting, and sharing profiles — so it will be convenient for you to switch between projects with different formatting styles. Additionally, you can automatically format code at the moment of check-in.

A PHP debugger with optimized memory usage and correct handling of symlinks (meaning fewer non-working breakpoints).

A PHP editor with improved type output for fields, object arrays, and logical expressions, parameter hints, and functional HEREDOC editing.

Remote development with automatic file synchronization — just switch to your browser window to see your changes on the server (the ""Save files on frame deactivation"" option must be enabled). Renaming and moving files and folders is fully supported.

Smarty support now covers the entire syntax of the 2.x branch. Work on full support for the 3.x branch is already underway.

Support for SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) — a wonderful way to create CSS.

Linux users will appreciate a less aggressive splash screen, the ability to work normally with multiple projects, and support for pasting from the clipboard in all dialogs.

UPD: ZenCoding support is in development. Abbreviations trigger on pressing Tab in CSS & HTML.

Known issues:

Formatting preview does not work
The IntelliLang plugin / Language Injection settings are missing
Smarty compiler plugins (custom tags) are not supported
(S)FTP sync may not work immediately after reopening the project.

Official announcement and download.

I look forward to your feedback and suggestions, and — as our slogan goes — 
Happy coding!"
php JetBrains IDE web IDE web web IDE editor phpdoc completion debugger Xdebug editor development environment development debugging code debugging autocompletion type hinting type inference type deducing PHPUnit unit testing testing FTP remote ZendCon language injection,"And once again, ""the perfect IDE for PHP"" from JetBrains. During the time since the last build, we managed to get an official website, attend ZendCon'09, and finally focus on the promised performance optimization. We also found time for several new features. While the build is downloading, take a look under the cut — besides the usual details, there will be a couple of words about ZendCon and the unique features of the platform/WI.

ZendCon'09  
Before the conference, there were tutorials — for me, the session PHP on IBM I5 was a revelation. IBM has joined forces with Zend to bring PHP to mainframes. Leaving aside the i5 ecosystem, this can have significant implications for everyone else, especially if IBM helps develop the core of the language. Version 5.3 already introduced some optimizations, but judging by other more ""mature"" technologies, the main work is still ahead.

The keynote (and most sessions) were very energetic and optimistic — this year PHP 5.3 was released, a new ZendStudio appeared (and specially for the conference, version 7.1 was also released), the improvement of the entire Zend stack and tools is ongoing; in general, the language, the platform, and the community are moving forward :)

During lunches, and while the main crowd was attending sessions, we had quite a bit of interaction with Zend employees — and even impressed some of the ZendStudio developers with our technologies. In turn, we were interested to hear about how they are developing the Eclipse platform and helping coordinate the efforts of the Eclipse Foundation. After all, JetBrains is quite a small company :) From an engineering perspective, it was interesting to hear about the work on the language core, as well as automatic profiling (especially from the standpoint of a seasoned Java web developer).

What’s new in this build  
Inspired by conversations with users at ZendCon, we focused on optimization. As ""stress tests,"" we used heavyweights like SugarCRM and Magento (we wanted to try Bitrix too but couldn't find a version with open source code). Right from the first profiling sessions, it became clear that type inference was generating too much ""garbage"" in memory, and could also lead to looping (and freezing) — these issues have been fixed now. I want to say right away that this is just initial optimization and we plan to take this seriously further. I *really* want to hear feedback from everyone who upgraded. If you have specific problems — feel free to reach out in any way. I personally handle all feedback.

New features:

- Improved generation of PHPDOC
- Navigation/search for usages of global variables
- Recognition of class members based on name for cases when type inference is not possible
- Support for SFTP
- Autocompletion after the keyword new
- Namespaces are displayed in the file structure tree
- Quickfix (Alt-Enter) for defining unknown variables using var

Many bug fixes; details in the blog and tracker.

Unfortunately, there are also known issues:

- The most serious one — degradation: multiline literals in this build are incorrectly highlighted as containing an error WI-494
- Several declarations of namespace XXX; (specifically with "";"") in one file will be mistakenly recognized as nested WI-497
- Renaming a variable removes the $ sign from the name WI-500

We will try to release an update as soon as possible. Expect bug fixes, optimizations, and of course new features :)

Something about non-obvious possibilities in WI  
The release is approaching, and we have started gathering all the information about WebIDE features in one place. Even if you have already gotten used to the editor, I recommend at least browsing through the list. Here, I'll talk about a couple of quite useful but not entirely obvious features. 

So, if your PHP project is used for generating XML, JS, CSS, SQL, or any other supported language in WebIDE, you can comfortably work using the following features:

""External"" language for PHP  
For each file or folder, you can set an ""external"" language in relation to PHP instead of the default HTML through the Settings|Template Data Languages panel. This setting is remembered in the project file.

""Internal"" language for string literals in PHP  
Inside the literal, press Alt-Enter and select ""Inject Language,"" and then choose the required language. So far, it is NOT remembered. In the future, it will be possible to specify that *for example* the first string parameter of the query() function is SQL (and select the dialect).

Full language support will be enabled for both cases — including completion and refactoring. Using these features, you can achieve full support for any combination of languages.

I'll wrap this up and look forward to any questions or suggestions :)"

In general, there are only a few fundamental competitions that set the tone for others, which are less grandiose and repeat the principles of the main ones. In every industry, in every type of activity, there is that person or team that does their job better than the rest. The Internet Awards, at this stage, are a kind of competition to determine who has thought best about the combination of design and ease of use, informativeness, and, of course, relevance. 

The World Web Awards, already in its development stages, has shown that it is unique and large-scale, like never before. An award that covers any activity on the Internet, whether it be design, copywriting, SEO promotion, application development, or programming. An award where your name can resonate so much that even people far from the Internet and your profession will mention it as a benchmark of quality in the industry. The uniqueness of holding the award lies in everything from its scale and the range of activities it encompasses to the awards ceremony, which will be conducted as a show program, with broadcasts on TV and radio rotation. Naturally, winners will be met with great fame and success in their field; an ordinary person who used to handle a few orders a day and would grasp any opportunity, after winning, can become popular and in demand, and start refusing offers that do not suit them.

The main motivation for participating in the World Web Awards will, of course, be to increase the popularity of one's name, which simultaneously means an increase in your profits. It can be said that popularity is indeed the fundamental factor of success in online activities. Even if you simply participate in this unique, first Internet award of this nature and scale, you can be sure that the traffic to your project will increase significantly."
